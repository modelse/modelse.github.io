Mark and Angie met in 2011 as they were getting out of their cars on the way to a

cooking class! Mark remembers seeing Angie, thinking “this is going to be fun”.

Well, they started talking right off and knew there was something special. This

was followed by dancing, dining, cooking and travel as their Love grew. They have

travelled together to the East Coast, Mexico and Hawaii as well as a very special

trip to Italy. So now, they are building a home together in Maple Valley and are

looking forward to having a long future together spending more time with family

and friends, traveling, dancing and …. to be continued.</p>
